 * DShow.h — DirectShow pipeline class declarations for WinDV.
 *
 * This header declares the complete object model used to capture DV video
 * from a FireWire (IEEE 1394) device to AVI files and to play AVI files
 * back to a DV device.  All pipeline construction and frame routing is
 * implemented in DShow.cpp.

 * Threading model:
 *   - CapturingThread / RecordingThread — consume frames from CDVQueue
 *   - MonitoringThread  — throttled preview delivery inside CMonitor
 *   - JoinerThread      — sequential file switching inside CAVIJoiner
 *
 * Error handling:
 *   HRESULT values from DirectShow calls are checked via CHECK_HR().
 *   On failure, CDShowException is thrown and caught by MFC TRY/CATCH_ALL.

 * CDVQueue
 *
 * Thread-safe fixed-capacity ring buffer (circular queue) for raw DV frames.
 *
 * Producer/consumer pattern:
 *   Producer thread (DirectShow callback or CAVIJoiner):

 *     m_evPut (a manual-reset CEvent) until the consumer has read at
 *     least one slot.  This provides backpressure: if the disk cannot
 *     keep up, the FireWire driver's own buffer absorbs the brief stall.
 *
 *   Consumer thread (CapturingThread / RecordingThread):
 *     Calls Get() to retrieve the oldest frame.  If the ring is empty,
 *     Get() blocks on m_evGet until the producer has enqueued a frame.
 *     Returns false immediately if m_end is set and the ring is empty,
 *     signaling end-of-stream to the consumer.
 *
 * End-of-stream:
 *   Put() with data == NULL sets m_end = true and signals both events so
 *   that a blocked consumer wakes and a blocked producer can also exit.
 *
 * Memory layout:
 *   A single contiguous allocation (m_buffers) holds all ring slots as an
 *   array of variable-length Buffer structs:
 *     [ header (duration + len) | data[dataSize] ] × queueSize+1
 *   m_queue[] is an array of pointers into m_buffers for O(1) slot access.
 *   The ring uses one extra slot (queueSize+1) to distinguish full from empty
 *   via the m_load counter (rather than relying on head == tail ambiguity).
 *
 * Synchronization:
 *   m_cs  - CCritSec protects m_head, m_tail, m_load.
 *   m_evGet - signaled by Put() each time a slot is filled.
 *   m_evPut - signaled by Get() each time a slot is freed.

/*
 * CDV
 *
 * Top-level orchestrator and MFC CStatic subclass.
 *
 * CDV owns the entire pipeline and exposes high-level Capture and Record
 * operations to the UI dialog.  It inherits CStatic so that it can be
 * placed directly on the dialog template as a picture control that also
 * hosts the preview window.
 *
 * State machine:
 *   Idle
 *     -> BuildCapturing()  -> CapturePaused
 *     -> BuildRecording()  -> RecordPaused
 *
 *   CapturePaused
 *     -> StartCapturing()  -> Capturing
 *     -> Destroy()         -> Idle
 *
 *   Capturing
 *     -> StopCapturing()   -> CapturePaused
 *     -> (time limit hit)  -> Finished
 *     -> Destroy()         -> Idle
 *
 *   RecordPaused
 *     -> StartRecording()  -> Recording
 *     -> Destroy()         -> Idle
 *
 *   Recording
 *     -> StopRecording()   -> RecordPaused
 *     -> (all files played)-> Finished
 *     -> Destroy()         -> Idle
 *
 *   Finished
 *     -> Destroy()         -> Idle
 *
 * CDV::HandleFrame() is the CFrameHandler implementation: it enqueues
 * every incoming DV frame into m_queue.  CapturingThread / RecordingThread
 * drain the queue and route frames to disk and the preview monitor.
 *
 * Thread safety:
 *   m_captureFilename is protected by m_cs.
 *   m_state transitions are made on the UI thread or on the worker threads
 *   at well-defined synchronization points.
