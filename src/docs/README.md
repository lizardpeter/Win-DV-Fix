## Quick Orientation

WinDV is a single-dialog MFC application layered as follows:

```text
CDVToolsDlg (UI)
  └── CDV (orchestrator, owns pipeline)
        ├── CDVInput / CAVIJoiner   (frame source)
        ├── CDVQueue                (ring buffer)
        ├── CAVIWriter / CDVOutput  (frame sink)
        └── CMonitor                (preview)
```

For the full class hierarchy see
[architecture.md](architecture.md).
For the DirectShow graph topologies see
[directshow-pipeline.md](directshow-pipeline.md).
For thread roles and synchronisation see
[threading.md](threading.md).
