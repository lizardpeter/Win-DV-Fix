A small Windows utility for DV (FireWire digital video) input/output.

Petr Mourek (Czech Republic) is the original author of WinDV, which was developed during 2002 and 2003. In 2010, Petr released the source code at [windv.mourek.cz](http://windv.mourek.cz/). If the site is down at the time of reading, the history can be viewed with the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/http://windv.mourek.cz/).

I am appointing myself as the new maintainer of WinDV because:
1. I would like to preserve Petr's work
2. I have benefitted from WinDV as it has allowed me to backup ageing [MiniDV tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV)
3. I find it incredibly interesting that a 20+ year old, abandoned program still has use today

## Getting Started

## Documentation

- [Project Overview](project-overview.md) — comprehensive technical overview (architecture, build instructions, CLI, configuration)
- [docs/](docs/README.md) — in-depth developer documentation (DirectShow pipeline, threading, DV format, UI layout, building)

## Contributing
I am still trying to figure out the best way to set up a development environment. I currently have hacked together a *working* environment in Windows 10, but it is less than ideal. More details on this soon.
